# Physics Backend

This library is intended to serve as a backend for applications utilizing 
complex physics equations and collision detection.

## Prerequisites

The following instructions assume that Docker, VSCode and Git are installed on 
the host computer. The VSCode extension Remote Development 
(ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) is required to open the project 
in a Dev Container. 

## Setting Up The Development Environment

1) Clone the repository onto the host computer with the following command:
   ```
    git clone https://github.com/hayesHowYaDoin/physics_engine.git
   ```
2) Open the folder in VSCode. In the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), execute 
the command "Dev Containers: Open Folder In Container..."

And... that's it!
